# The mission

You must create a class step by step by ensuring the following tests are completed.

Create a new branch/fork on this solution with your following code convention:
dev-[githubuser]#Try

In example, in my first try I would create a branch **dev-naadev#1**. If I want to start from scratch, I would create a new branch **dev-naadev#2**

## The objective

You must refine the class assigned to this project using only one of the two testing projects which are prepared for you to avoid installing anything.

First project is xUnit based, the second one extends xUnit by using Specflow (a Cucumber compatible implementation)

## Instructions and goals

We will analyze the effor made on coding tests. along with the maintainability and some other metrics. **Don't worry if your class is not perfect, but be sure you only move to next step once the test has been completed**

You shall make first scenario to run succesfully on a valid code solution. After that, you can implement second scenario.

Every time you complete a new test, do a commit. That will help us to track the evolution.

We will need to you implement following scenarios in one or more tests.

We will need to track the time which is required to fullfill the scenarios. So, we kindly request you to push each commit too.

## Narrative
